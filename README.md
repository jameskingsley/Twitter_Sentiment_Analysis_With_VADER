Twitter Sentiment Analysis with VADER
This project uses VADER Sentiment Analysis to process and analyze tweets from a CSV file. The app takes input as a CSV file containing tweets, preprocesses the text, performs sentiment analysis, and generates insightful visualizations like a Word Cloud, Sentiment Distribution Bar Chart, Pie Chart, and Hourly Sentiment Trends. It also provides a downloadable CSV of processed results.

Features
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of each tweet using VADER, a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool.

Word Cloud: Generates a word cloud based on the tweet content, excluding stop words and user-defined filter words.

Sentiment Distribution: Displays sentiment distribution using a bar chart and pie chart.

Hourly Sentiment Trends: Plots a graph showing sentiment trends based on the hour of the tweet's timestamp.

Downloadable CSV: The processed data can be downloaded as a CSV file for further analysis.
